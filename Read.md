# Parkinson's Disease Detection Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the "Parkinson's Disease Detection" machine learning code. The code is designed to predict whether an individual has Parkinson's disease based on various features derived from voice recordings. The code employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are imported to facilitate the implementation of the code:

- **numpy** (`np`): Used to handle arrays and numerical computations.
- **pandas** (`pd`): Utilized for creating and manipulating structured data frames.
- **sklearn**: A fundamental library for machine learning, providing essential tools like model selection, preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **svm** from `sklearn`: Represents the Support Vector Machine algorithm.
- **StandardScaler** from `sklearn.preprocessing`: Utilized for standardizing features by removing mean and scaling to unit variance.
- **accuracy_score** from `sklearn.metrics`: Used to calculate the accuracy of the model predictions.

## Data Collection and Analysis

The code's data analysis phase involves several steps:

1. **Loading Data**: The Parkinson's disease dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame named `parkinsons_data`.
2. **Initial Exploration**: The first five rows of the DataFrame are displayed using `parkinsons_data.head()`.
3. **Data Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the DataFrame is determined using `parkinsons_data.shape`.
4. **Dataset Information**: The dataset's information, including data types and non-null counts, is displayed using `parkinsons_data.info()`.
5. **Missing Values Check**: Missing values in each column are checked using `parkinsons_data.isnull().sum()`.
6. **Descriptive Statistics**: Various statistical measures are obtained through `parkinsons_data.describe()`.
7. **Target Distribution**: The distribution of the target variable ('status') is displayed via `parkinsons_data['status'].value_counts()`.
8. **Grouping Data**: Data is grouped based on the 'status' column to calculate means for each case.

## Data Pre-processing

1. **Separating Features and Target**: Features are separated from the target variable ('status') to create two variables, `X` (features) and `Y` (target).
2. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. Four arrays are generated: `X_train`, `X_test`, `Y_train`, and `Y_test`.

## Data Standardization

1. **Standardization**: The `StandardScaler` is used to standardize the training and testing feature data. This helps ensure consistent ranges and improves model performance.

## Model Training

1. **Support Vector Machine Model**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel is created using the `svm.SVC` class from `sklearn`. The model is trained on the standardized training data using the `fit` method.

## Model Evaluation

1. **Accuracy Score**: The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using the `accuracy_score` metric. Accuracy is calculated for both the training and testing data and displayed as percentages.

## Building a Predictive System

1. **Input Data**: An example input data point is provided, representing features extracted from voice recordings.
2. **Prediction**: The input data is converted into a numpy array, reshaped, and standardized using the previously fit scaler. The trained SVM model then predicts the status (0 for healthy, 1 for Parkinson's disease) based on the standardized input data.
3. **Output**: The prediction result is displayed, indicating whether the person is predicted to have Parkinson's disease or not.

## Conclusion

This documentation has provided an in-depth explanation of the "Parkinson's Disease Detection" code. By following the code's steps, users can understand how the dataset is processed, how a Support Vector Machine model is trained, and how predictions are made to identify individuals with Parkinson's disease.
